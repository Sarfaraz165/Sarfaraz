this keyword
Scanner class



what is the use of this keyword ?

1) this keyword is used for calling from one constructor
to another.
while calling constructor using this keyword, this 
will be the first statement and we can't write more
than one this keyword.


2) this keyword is used for calling from one method to
another

in case of method calling using this keyword, you can write
this statement anywhere and you can write more than 
one this statement in case of method calling.

in case of constructor, we can write only one this statement
inside a constructor

but in case of method, we can write more than one this
statement inside a method

_______________________________________________

What are the use of this keyword 

1) for calling from one constructor to another
2) for calling from one method to another
3) for differentiating the local variable and global variable
when the variable names are same.


1) Class Creation-------variable+method+constructor
2) creation of main method
3) object creation inside main method
4) calling the method and variable using reference_variable

we can call the global variable using reference_variable
we can't call the local variable becuase local variable 
has scope in that method only

it is not able to differentiate when the local variable
and gloval variable names are same.

this.deepak ----------it will point to the global variable

use of this keyword

1) for calling one constructor from another
2) for calling method from another method
3) for differentiating the local variable and global variable

has a relationship


we can create the object of a class anywhere
with in same class or in the different class or in
the different package.

______________________________________________________

as of now, no but with the help of jar we can create the 
object of a class in different project also.

What is the use of the Scanner Class ?
with the help of Scanner Class we can take input from the
user.

it is given by java.


After : whatever is written that is the return type of that 
method.

After - whatever is written that means that method belong
to that class



has a relationship

we have created the object of Scanner class in our class.

that is has a relationship

we can create the object of a class anywhere
within sameclass
within 


_______________________________________

 for scanner class

((((((x1+x2)-x3)*x4)+x5)/x6) 

((((((x1*x2)-x3)+x4)-x5)/x6) 

where x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 and x6 you will take from the user
and you need to create 4 methods

______________________________________

Output should be in the below sequence using this keyword

3 parameterized method
default method
4 parameterized method
1 parameterized method 
2 parameterized method


_______________________________________

has a relationship assignment 

create the object of a class
within same class and call method
outside class in another class and call method
outside class in another package and call method
