1.use of super keyword
2.Polymorphism
3.Real time example of the Polymorphism from automation perspective
4.final keyword

_____________________________________________

what is the use of the super keyword ?
1) 
for calling the parent class parameterized constructor
if you are not writing the super keyword in that case
parent class default constructor will be called.

in case of constructor, super will be the first statement 
within that constructor and you can't write more than one
super statement.


2) for calling the parent method
   in case of method calling you can write the super
   statement anywhere
   although you can do this thing using child reference_variable

3) for calling the parent variable

___________________________________________________

you can't call the local variable of a method in other class
or with in same class

OOPS Concept 
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Class and Object

*****************************************

when we design a method, what are the key things
methodname
methodInputs
methodOutput


static polymorphism
methodname------------must be same
methodInputs data type---------will not same
method output data type--------can be same or can't be same



when we are writing the code that is the compile time
environment and at the compile time you are deciding
which method you want to call it's up to you
as per your requirement you can call the corresponding
method.


when a method will return ?
when we need the result of that method for further use

when a method will not return ?
when we don't need the result of that method for further use



first method----------int int float
second method---------int float int 

it will work yes 


firstly child class object will check inside the
parent class

As of now we are working on the chrome 100 tcs
next 50 tcs automate -----------firefox 

existing code-------if else -------not good approach

a new method that will work based upon the firefox browser


overloading will happen in the same class
overriding will happen in the inheritance


final keyword---------------
for making the constant

which can't be change


if you will make a class as a final you can't inherit
that class.

if you will make a method as a final then you can't
override it.
