/*some real time example of abstraction
Collections in Java

______________________________________________

What is Abstraction 
hiding the internal information from the external world
that is abstraction


when some functionality is common then we will define that functionality in the 
abstract class.

_______________________________________________

What is Collection ?
Collection is a framework given by Java which is used
for storing multiple objects

__________________________________________________

Object is the parent class of all classes in java

all the classes in java are inheriting the Object Class

_________________________________________________


What is the concept of generic ?
anything we will define in the <> that collection
can store that type of objects.


what is int ?
int is a data type

What is Integer ?
Integer is a class

int is a data type
Integer isa class


if you want to convert a int/Integer into String
you can convert a Integer into String
but you can't convert a int into String because int 
is a data type

whatever class name we will mention in the <> that 
collection can store that type of objects

we have discuss

as of now we have discussed three loops
for 
while 
do  while

now we will discuss enchance for loop 
that is for each loop

there is  no need of initilization,condition check
or increment decrement in the for each loop


what is the difference between arraylist and linkedlist



1) Searching is faster in the arraylist because searching
will be happen based upon the index Number

Linkedlist --------there is a concept of node in the 
linkedlist

Searching is slower in the linkedlist

2) Insertion and Deletion------------
Insertion and Deletion is slower in the arraylist

Insertion and deletion is faster in the linkedlist.


keySet() -------it will return all the keys of that map


keySet() is the method returning the Set of all keys where
key can be any type


we will discuss the real time scenarios of the collection.
