/*What are the four pillers of a program

1) Class creation
2) main method Creation
3) object creation inside main method
4) calling the variable and method using reference_variable


What is Class ?
A Class contains/represent variable and Method


there is nothing like that object

we create the reference_variable that will point to 
that object memory.

Each Object has its own sepearte memory

___________________________________________________

What is method ?
Ans:To performing any operation/action we create method for it. 
1).There are 6 types of methods given below.
##Methods Flavour:-
1).default
2).Parameterized
3).Will return
4).will not return
5).Static
6).Non Static
7).With Body(Concrete Method)
8).Without Body(Abstract Method)

Abstraction is hiding the internal information from the external world.

Under abstractions, there are two things as 1).Abstract Class 2).Interface.

Abstract Class can be withBody or withoutBody

 * Interface : Only without body
 * 
 * Q1.Who will give the the body to the abstract method of abstract class or interface.
 * Ans.The class which will inherit the abstract class or interface will give the body to the abstract method.
 * 
 * We can't create the object of the abstract class or interface.
 * 
 * This is the mapping to extends the following
 * Class------Class-----------extends
 * Interface---Class---------Implements
 * Interface--Interface------extends



_____________________________________________


void ----void means when a method will not return any result
that is void method.

non void ------non void means when a method will return 
any result that is non void method.

when you will make a method as a void ?
when we don't need the result of that method for further use
we will make it as a void method.

when we will make a method as a non void ?
when we need the result of that method for further use 
in that case we will make it as a non void method.

__________________________________________

if a method is taking inputs then it will be parameterized method
if a method is not taking inputs then it will be default method


syso is not related to returning or not returning

when a method is returning we can write syso in that case also
when a method is not reurning we can write syso in that case also


1) Class Creation------------put variable and methods
2) main method Creation
3) object creation inside main method
4) calling the variable nd method using reference-variable



when you will write void then you can't write return statement
when you will make a method no void in that case
you have to write the return statement.


___________________________________________

Student s=new Student();

Here new keyword will create the object
afrer that memory will be allocated
there will be some address of that memory
reference_variable will point to that memory address




___________________________

Local variable ----------scope in that method only
Global variable-----------can be use in the whole class


implicit and explicit conversion(data type conversion)
______________________________

Assignment1------------>

(((((10+2)+2)-2)*2)/2)

sum,sub,mul,div 
you will define sum method only once
you call it twice
int sum_result=ref.sum(10,2);
int sum_result2=ref.sum(sum_result,2);
ref.sub
mul
div




Assignment2------------>

(((((10-2)*2)-2)+2)/2)


A method can return a single value now

but in future we will discuss a method can return multiple value 
as well.
