Constructor
why we create constructor
constructor vs method
type of the constructor
this keyword
type of variables
_____________________________________________

1) Constructor is like method
2) constructor name and class name will be same
3) no return type
4) no need to call, it will be called by itself when
we will create the object of the class.

like for a method, we have to call using reference_variable.
methodname();

but in case of constructor there is no need to call, as 
you will create the object of the class constructor
will be called by itself.


_________________________________________

THere are two types of the constructor

1) Default constructor
2) parameterized constructor


_______________________________________

1) Class Creation---------Put variable/method/constructor in it
2) main method creation
3) object creation
4) calling the variable and method using reference_variable

Classname reference_variable=new Classname();

Here new keyword will create the object, after that memory will
be allocated. there will be some address of that memory
reference_variable will point to that memory address


COnstructor vs Method ?


Each class has a default constructor in the backend

and nothing has done in that constructor.


at a time, single constructor will be called.

when we will create first object, the corresponding
constructor will be called

when we will create second object, the corresponding 
constructor will be called

_____________________________

if the number of arguments for two constructor is same
then the data type should not match in the sequence

or the number of arguments are not same.

in case of float we need to write F

Why we are creating the constructor or Consructor vs Method


What are the type of the variables ?
there are two type of the variables

1) global variable
2) local variable


What are the global variables ?
that we can use in the whole class.

global variable-----variable declared in the class and outside
the method.

local variable-----the variable which we declared in the method
and that we can use in that method only.

What is the use of Constructor ?
Constructor is used for assigning the values for an object
Constructor is used for giving the values for an object
Constructor is used for constructting the values for an object

number of calls reduce.


Constructor vs method 

if we are doing the same activity with the help of method
by creating 5 parameterized method. 

but in that case, you need to call that method

but in case of constructor there is no need to call.


______________________________________________


let's take a example from the automation perspective

__________________________________________

we have seen we want to call all the constructor 
how many objects we need to create ?

three constructor
in this case we need to create three objects

there is a keyword named this keyword?

what is the use of this keyword ?
this keyword is used for calling from one constructor to
another
in case of constructor calling, this will be the first statement 
and we can't write more than one this statement in a constructor


how you can call from one constructor to another 
using this statement and this will be the first statement
and we can't write more than one this keyword inside 
a constructor.

__________________________________

Output should be in the below sequence

4 parameterized constructor
default constructor 
1 parameterized constructor
3 parameterized constructor
2 parameterized constructor

_______________________________________________________

this keyword is used for calling from one constructor 
to another constructor


main control + space
classname control + space
