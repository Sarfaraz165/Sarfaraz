________________________________________________

What is Selenium 
Selenium is a open source tool for the web based application
automation means we can automate the frontend of the application
using Selenium 
which support multiple languages means you can do  
selenium with java
selenium with python
selenium with C#

we can automate on different different browsers on different different 
OS

we can't automate api using selenium
we can't automate database using selenium(we can do with java code)

rest assured---rest assured is the java library for the api automation

________________________________________________

selenium is a library which will provide the classes and methods 
for the automation

jxl was a library which provides the classes and method
for handling the excel


rest assured is a library which provides the classes and methods
for rest api automation

_______________________________________________


selenium is a tool consist of 4 components 
in those components, selenium webdriver is a library

_____________________________________________


components in selenium 

1) Selenium IDE
2) Selenium RC
3) Selenium Webdriver
4) Selenium Grid-

Selenium IDE------------Selenium IDE is a plugin for record
and play back earlier selenium has given the support of this
plugin on the FF browser only, now they have given the
support of Chrome browser as well
but in the market selenium ide is not in used.

______________________________________________________

Selenium RC(Remote Control)
earlier in selenium ide that was supported by FF browser
selenium introduced RC component that support multiple
browsers.RC is also deprected

we need to start the server again and again
it doesn't support the multiple handling
it doesn't support the ajex calls

___________________________________________________

Selenium Webdriver
Selenium Webdriver is a library.for each library there
is corresponding jar files. for each jar file there
is corresponding maven dependencies

library---------jar----------maven dependency

what is library ?
which provides built in classes and methods

What is the architecture of Selenium Webdriver 

they have given the selenium webdriver jar file or
selenium maven dependencies

so they have created a project of selenium webdriver

Webdriver is a interface in programming term
Webdriver is a library which provides the built in classes and methods



_________________________________________________

Selenium Grid that is used for parallel execution with docker

___________________________________________________


Selenium Webdriver is a library, which provides the
built in classes and methods

so we need the Selenium Webdriver jars file

and we need the browser exe file(given by selenium)

________________________________________________


How we will work in selenium ?

anything on the page any button,any text button,
any drop down,any radio button, any text written 
we call it webelement

Webelement is a interface in programming term

______________________________________________

there are two basic principles

1) firstly we need to identify webelement uniquely on
which we want to work

2) After that we can perform the action(action can be click,
value pass,drop down selection etc)


_____________________________________________

How to identify a webelement uniquely ?

1) id
2) name
3) classname
4) cssselector
       1) Tag with ID ----------------Tagname#IDValue
       2) Tag with classname----------TagName.ClassValue
       3) Tag with attribute----------Tagname[attribNam='attValue']
       4) Tag with class with attribute--TagName.ClassValue[attribuName='attValue']      

there are a number of techniques given by selenium to identify a webelement uniquely, these are the element locating technique or element locators

if you are able to locate with id then why you will go with name/classname/cssselector



______________________________________________

we need the selenium jar files 

1) selenium old jars(these are the stable 2.48 version)
2) selenium new jars 

and attach both the jars with our project


we need the browser exe file.

depending upon your browser version you will download
the corresponding exe file



after downloading the jar files and exe file

extract the folders


_______________________________

Browser launch + url hit + maximize + use id technique
