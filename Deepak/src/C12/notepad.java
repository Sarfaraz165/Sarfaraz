What is the benefit of jar creation

what is a has a relationship 

we are creating the object of a class in another class
within same package

we are creating the object of a class in another class
in another package

that is has a relationship

scanner class is part of my project or my workspace ?
no 

but i am able to use.

how because inside my project there are some java jar files
and scanner class is defined in those jars

.........................................Steps to create project jar file: for ProjectA AND Used in ProjectB..........................................................................................
How to create the jar file

firstly convert your project into maven project

now with the help of maven goal we can create the
jar file of the project

you will get the jar file in the target folder

maven clean
it will delete whatever in the target folder of your project

now you will execute the goal
maven package
with the help of package goal it will create the
jar file of your project

now you will share that jar file to the navneet
and navneet will import that jar file 
and he will able to use the classes and methods of
deepak project.




 D:\9AMBatch_26Se\ProjectA\target\ProjectA-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

when you will run the goal package you will get a problem

what is that problem

it will give the error

Perhaps you are using the JRE you need to use the JDK 
for your project.

how to change from JRE to JDK for the project.


How we will pass the JDK to our project.


How to find the .java file from the jar file

by default it will show you the
.class file 


why we are creating the jar file

in the real scenario we will not share the code
we will share the jar file

selenium jars ------------whatever classes+methods defined in this 
jar file  we can use in our project after importing the
jar file

static keyword

Each object has its own seprate memory


in case of static memory will be allocated at class level
instead of object level

What is the benefit of making static 

if you make anything static you don't need to create the object
you can call directly by classname


A static method can use the static variable
A non static method can use both(static and non static vari)

What are the different OOPS concept

Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Class and Object

what is the benefit of the abstraction
some real time example of abstraction from the automation
perspective

abstract class contains both type of method(abstract + concrete)
interface contains only abstract method

why we are doing this thing

from the where abstraction comes into the picture
from the automation perspective where abstraction come
into picture

String handling
Exception handling
Array
Db connectivity
Access specifiers
upcasting and downcasting in java
